	/*	QUE AND ANS ON JAVA LANG
	 
1) What is the main difference between String and StringBuilder?
2) What is the meaning of immutability and mutability?
3) Explain immutability and mutability with an example?
4) What is SCP?  A specially designed memory area for the String literals.
5) What is the advantage of SCP?  Instead of creating a separate object for every requirement we can create only one
object and we can reuse same object for every requirement. This approach improves
performance and memory utilization.
6) What is the disadvantage of SCP?  In SCP as several references pointing to the same object by using one reference if we are
performing any changes the remaining references will be inflected. To prevent this
compulsory String objects should be immutable. That is immutability is the disadvantage
of SCP.
7) Why SCP like concept available only for the String but not for the StringBuffer?  As String object is the most commonly used object sun people provided a specially
designed memory area like SCP to improve memory utilization and performance.  But StringBuffer object is not commonly used object hence specially designed memory
area is not at all required.
8) Why String objects are immutable where as StringBuffer objects are mutable?  In the case of String as several references pointing to the same object, by using one
reference if we are allowed perform the change the remaining references will be
impacted. To prevent this once we created a String object we can’t perform any change
in the existing object that is immutability is only due to SCP.  But in the case of StringBuffer for every requirement we are creating a separate object
by using one reverence if we are performing any change in the object the remaining
references won’t be impacted hence immutability concept is not require for the
StringBuffer.
9) Similar to String objects any other objects are immutable in java?  In addition to String all wrapper objects are immutable in java.
10) Is it possible to create our own mutable class? >Yes.//using private properties(variable)(atributes) and factory method..
11) Explain the process of creating our own immutable class with an example?
12) What is the difference between final and immutability?
13) What is interning of String objects?
